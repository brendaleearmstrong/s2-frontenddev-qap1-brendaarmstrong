    <p><b>ðŸš§ Alert: Moose Mating Season in Progress! ðŸš§ </b> <br>
        During this time, moose are more active and may unexpectedly cross roads, posing increased risks to drivers. Please exercise heightened caution while driving, especially at dawn and dusk when visibility is lower and moose are most active. Adhere to speed limits, stay vigilant for wildlife crossing signs, and use high beam headlights responsibly in dark areas to spot moose from a distance. Remember, moose are large and their eyes don't reflect headlights, making them harder to see at night. In case of a moose sighting, slow down, honk gently to encourage them to move, but never swerve suddenly, which could lead to loss of vehicle control. Your safety and the protection of our wildlife are paramount. Drive safely and keep our roads moose-accident-free.</p>
